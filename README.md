# DATA-MINING-PROJECT-
**Project Description:**

Our project is designed as a classification task, with the primary objective of predicting loan approval outcomes. Using applicant-related attributes such as income, credit history, requested loan amount, marital status, and employment details, our model aims to determine whether a loan application should be classified as Approved or Rejected.

**Objectives:**

Our main objectives in this project are to build a classification model that can predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected. We aim to improve the accuracy of the predictions so that the chances of misclassification are reduced. Through this work, we want to support financial institutions by making the loan approval process faster, less dependent on manual work, and more consistent. In addition, we will analyze the key features that have the greatest impact on loan approval, giving useful insights into how applicants are assessed.

**Project Motivation:**

The motivation for our project comes from the critical impact that loan approval decisions have on both financial institutions and individuals. On one hand, banks and lenders must carefully assess applications to minimize financial risk; on the other, applicants rely on fair, transparent, and timely decisions in order to gain access to needed financial support.
Manual evaluation of loan applications is often time‑consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error or bias. Different evaluators may interpret similar applicant data differently, leading to discrepancies and potential unfairness. Moreover, delays in decision-making hurt customer satisfaction and may reduce trust in lending systems.
